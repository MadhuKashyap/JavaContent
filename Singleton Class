1. singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time.
2. After first time, if we try to instantiate the Singleton class, the new variable also points to the first instance created. 
3. We can make a class singleton by: 
      3.1 Make constructor as private.
      3.2 Write a static method that has return type object of this singleton class.
     
4. For singleton class we use getInstance() method instaed of constructor to instantiate.
  `         class Singleton 
          {
              private static Singleton single_instance = null;
 
              public String s;
 
              private Singleton()
              {
                  s = "Hello I am a string part of Singleton class";
               }
                public static Singleton getInstance()
             {
                  if (single_instance == null)
                  single_instance = new Singleton();
 
                  return single_instance;
              }
         }
         
         class GFG {
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Singleton x = Singleton.getInstance();
        Singleton y = Singleton.getInstance();
        Singleton z = Singleton.getInstance();
        System.out.println("Hashcode of x is "+ x.hashCode());
        System.out.println("Hashcode of y is "+ y.hashCode());                    
        System.out.println("Hashcode of z is " + z.hashCode());
    }
    //All hashcodes are same.
