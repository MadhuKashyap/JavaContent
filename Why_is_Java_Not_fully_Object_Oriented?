1. Java language is not a Pure Object Oriented Language as it contains Primitive Data Type like  int, long, bool, float, char.

2.  Wrapper class provides the mechanism to convert primitive into object and object into primitive.

3. A Wrapper class is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive data types into wrapper class objects.

4. Autoboxing: Automatic conversion of primitive types to the object of their corresponding wrapper classes is known as autoboxing. 
       char ch = 'a';
       Character a = ch;
       
5. Unboxing: Automatically converting an object of a wrapper class to its corresponding primitive type is known as unboxing
      Character a = 'a';
      char ch=a
